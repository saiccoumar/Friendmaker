# Friendmaker
## Instructions
-- !summon: sends a message with instructions
-- !make roles: makes interest roles for users to assign to themselves
-- !prune channels: cleans up excess channels that might get left behind by crashed bots 
-- !find a friend: users use this command to find a friend. 
-- !cache users: sometimes the user list gets outdated so run this once when the bot gets added/restarted and whenever there's a large influx of new people
-- !list users: lists all cached users. This might be a bad idea with 1k people in a server, I used it for testing.
-- prune channel requires MANAGE_CHANNELS priviliges. finding friends doesn't require any privileges. Every other command needs ADMIN priviliges.
